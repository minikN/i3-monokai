## Target file for polybar.
## In this file you can specify a target where the polybar generator file will be copied to
## when applied. If you didn't specify a source file when you created the generator, the
## variable below will be empty. Just add the path to the file after a whitespace, or comment
## it out entirely if you don't want to copy anything.
